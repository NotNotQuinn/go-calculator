# go-calculator
First go project KKona

## Useage

Simply `go run .` and type a math expression.

Only the first 3 words are taken into consideration, and things like `1+1` will not work, they must be seperated by spaces like so: `1 + 1`.

Valid operations:
  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`

## Things I used

I used goroutines, functions, a custom seperate package, built in packages, errors, channels, switches, structs, controll flow, receiver types, and more.

100% got what I wanted out of this.
